# Jones-CV

I utilized the [Orbit Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv/). I have developed my cover letter utilizing the following theme and will be
developing it toward my own needs. 

If you want to use my version as I develop it over time, you can use it from the template I built utilizing the [Orbit Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv) at my [Jones-CV Repo](https://github.com/bigboss424/jones-cv/). I used that to generate this version my original template to have the ability to launch it on gh-pages. 

I am open to any suggestions as to improvements that you would like to see be done, otherwise feel free to utilize this repo to meet your project requirements.
